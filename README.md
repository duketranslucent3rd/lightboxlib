# Lightbox Lib

[Documentation & examples here](https://mitya.uk/projects/lightbox-lib)

Lightbox Lib is a suite of lightbox-related tools. Its focus is on providing a sophisticated API for HTML-based modal dialogs, but can also be used to:

- Show in-DOM elements i.e. interfaces intended for display in a lightbox
- Show loading progress indicators e.g. for AJAX uploads
- Auto generate lightbox-hosted carousels, e.g. for cycling through product photos
- Fetch and show, via lightbox, images or pages not currently in the DOM
